# metahuman_endtoend
Test animation and render for end to end, UE5 to Maya back to UE5 workflow   
*Brotools blocking the quixel plugin from loading. Quixel plugin needed for face connection*

## Installing MS megascans plugin to Maya
I find that uninstalling Maya and all its plugins, MtoA, USD, Bitfrost, deleteing Documents/Users/maya, and C:\program Files\Autodesk\maya, deleting bridge and reinstalling all, helps.

Mayabe you can try just removing bridge, and Documents/Users/maya/2022/modules and reinstalling

### Tips
When exporting MetaHumans into Autodesk Maya, you might experience textures missing from your MetaHuman.
As a workaround, in Maya, make sure you have DirectX 11 set as your Rendering engine. You can do this by going to Windows > Settings/Preferences > Display > Viewport 2.0 then set DirectX 11 as the Rendering engine from there.

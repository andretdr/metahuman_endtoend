# metahuman_endtoend
Test animation and render for end to end, UE5 to Maya back to UE5 workflow   

## Installing MS megascans plugin to Maya
I installed MS mod on maya 2022 and Brotools onto 2024.   
C:\Users\Andre\Documents\maya\2022\modules\quixel.mod   
C:\Users\Andre\Documents\maya\2024\modules\brotools.mod   

Seems like MS plugin is VERY sensitive, even importing hotkeys will break it.   

I install new Maya 2022, new Bridge.   
I import all my hotkeys and layouts FIRST, *THEN* install the plugin.   

## Resetting
I find that uninstalling Maya 2022 deleteing Documents/Users/maya/2022, deleting bridge and reinstalling all, helps.

### Tips
When exporting MetaHumans into Autodesk Maya, you might experience textures missing from your MetaHuman.
As a workaround, in Maya, make sure you have DirectX 11 set as your Rendering engine. You can do this by going to Windows > Settings/Preferences > Display > Viewport 2.0 then set DirectX 11 as the Rendering engine from there.
